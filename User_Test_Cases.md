### Test Case 1:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- A person is within the field of view of the RealSense camera.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should initiate the RealSense pipeline.
- Pose estimation should be performed on the detected person.
- The robot should publish Twist messages to '/cmd_vel' based on the person's position and depth information.
- Calculate and print the expected turn.
- The robot should move forward if the person is farther than the desired distance, stop if at the desired distance, and move backward if closer than the desired distance.

### Test Case 2:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- No person is within the field of view of the RealSense camera.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should initiate the RealSense pipeline.
- Since no person is detected, print "No person detected!".
- The robot should not publish any Twist messages.

### Test Case 3:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The RealSense camera does not provide valid color or depth frames.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should handle the absence of valid frames gracefully.
- Pose estimation should not be performed.
- The robot should not publish any Twist messages.

### Test Case 4:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The operator triggers the termination of the script by pressing 'q' in the 'Mediapipe Feed' window.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should stop the RealSense pipeline and close the 'Mediapipe Feed' window when the 'q' key is pressed.

### Test Case 5:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The person is within the field of view of the RealSense camera.
- Depth information is not available.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should handle the absence of depth information gracefully.
- Print a message indicating the absence of depth information.
- The robot should not publish any Twist messages.

### Test Case 6:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The person is within the field of view of the RealSense camera.
- Pose estimation fails.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should handle pose estimation failures gracefully.
- Print a message indicating the failure.
- The robot should not publish any Twist messages.

### Test Case 7:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- Multiple persons are within the field of view of the RealSense camera.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should handle multiple persons within the frame.
- Select and follow the closest person.
- Print appropriate messages regarding the selected person's position and movement.

### Test Case 8:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The person is within the field of view of the RealSense camera.
- The person moves dynamically.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should continuously update the person's position based on real-time pose estimation.
- Adjust its movement accordingly and continuously print the updated expected turn.

### Test Case 9:

**Given:**
- The robot is powered on.
- The ROS environment is set up correctly.
- The person is initially outside the field of view and enters later.

**When:**
- The `main()` function is executed, running the `PoseEstimationNode`.

**Then:**
- The robot should handle the dynamic entry of a person into the frame.
- Start tracking the person's movements once detected and print relevant information.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure robustness and functionality in different situations. Adjust specifics based on your system's behavior and requirements.
